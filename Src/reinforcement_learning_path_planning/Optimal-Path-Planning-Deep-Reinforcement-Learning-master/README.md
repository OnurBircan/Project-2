# Optimal Path Planning: Deep Reinforcement Learning
Optimal Path Planning with Deep Reinforcement Learning

Basic concepts of Q learning algorithm, markov Decision Processes, Temporal Difference, and Deep Q Networks are used 
to train a tiny car find the optimal path from top left corner to bottom right corner.
